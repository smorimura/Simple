10 rem this simple program takes in a positive integer value and raises it
20 rem to the power of the second positive integer entered
30 input q
40 input f
45 rem have a value of one to print in case the factor is 0
50 let c = 1
55 rem r will be a constant value so that q can change as it is being multiplied
60 let r = q
65 rem if either value is negative end the program
70 if q < 0 goto 170
80 if f < 0 goto 170
85 rem if the power is 0 then the value will be 1
90 if f == 0 goto  160
95 rem when the power value gets down to 1 this will cause the program to print the value and end the program
100 if f == 1 goto  140
110 let q = q * r
115 rem 
120 let f = f - 1
130 goto 100
140 print q
150 end
160 print c
170 end
